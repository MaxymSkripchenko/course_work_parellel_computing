##How to run the program
To run the code you need to have c++ compiler that is support c++17 standart bec
ause of usage of filesystem library. I recommend using some kind of IDE such as
Visual Studio.
###Visual Studio
If you want to run code in Visual Studio, you first need to install it from official website. Once you installed it, create new empty cpp project. Once it is created, you should place my file in resourse file folder. Than go to project properties -> c++ -> language -> version of standart and chose c++17. That build the project. Also, if you have you dataset in other directiry than in my code, you should change it.
